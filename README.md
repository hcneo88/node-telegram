Telegram-Webthings Integration.

Webthings are my internet of things objects which ESP8266 SOC,  programmed using the UnifyServer library.  Out of the box, the UnifyServer comes with a webserver with OTA capability, webservices API, and MQTT integration via user defineable callback in response to subscribed topic.

The Telegram-Webthings application provides the UI to interface with these objects via the messenger services.
